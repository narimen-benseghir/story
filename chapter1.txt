i am praying and doing good these days i am more happy because i am trying to change my life 
i am working in something that i love full of challenges
and i am really doing good al hamdullah it's all because of 
Allah
i was trying so hard for so long but i really didn't know what to do 
or how am i suppose to do all of those things , i am more healthy alhamdullah 
i am more stable i guess and i have a nice income 6 million is more than enough to 
make me live a nice life in algeria
 i am driving now too , it was a dream to me that i made it true 
 i am doing good thanks to Allah, don't get me wrong i'm far from being perfect but i really 
 hope that i continue in this path ...
